Simple math game for ages 3-10.

User will enter their name, age (3-10), and select a game type from Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, and Division.

The game consists of ten questions based on the selected game type and has a timer that starts ticking up from zero.

If a user gets a question correct the game will display a label indicating that the answer was correct and a sound will play.

If the user gets a question incorrect a label will be displayed indicating the answer was wrong and a different sound will play.

Once all ten questions have been answered the game will show a final score page showing how many questions were answered correctly,
  how long it took to complete (in seconds), and there will be a background and sound indicating how well they did in three brackets
  which include 0-3, 4-7, and 8-10 correct answers.
